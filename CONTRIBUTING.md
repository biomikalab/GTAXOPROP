## Preamble
GTAXOPROP is a utility that generates input files for taxonomy propagation and assignment in QIIME/QIIME2 from the NCBI database. It converts NCBI accession numbers into QIIME/QIIME2-compatible taxonomy files with an API fallback.

GTAXOPROP is a volunteer-driven effort. If you are interested in joining, we welcome you to be part of this collaborative project by emailing biomika.genbinesia@gmail.com. We encourage you to get involved and volunteer with us!
